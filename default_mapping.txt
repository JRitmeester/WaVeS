# Make sure this file is placed in the same directory as vc.exe. To make this startup on boot (for Windows), create a
# shortcut and place it in the Start-up folder.

# Application is either "master" for master volume, the application name "spotify.exe" (case insensitive) for Spotify
# (for Windows, this can be found in Task Manager under the "Details" tab), "unmapped" for any and all applications
# that are currently running, but have not been explicitly assigned a slider. "unmapped" excludes the master channel.
# Finally, "system" allows you to control the system sound volume.

# Stick to the syntax:
#<number>:<application>
# Here, number is the index
0: master
1: system
2: chrome.exe
3: spotify.exe
4: unmapped

# Find the device name when the sliders are connected to USB in Device Manager, so that when you switch USB ports,
# you don't have to change the COM port.
device name: Arduino Micro

# Indicate the number of sliders you're using:
sliders: 5
# Port is only used if the device name can't be found automatically.
port:COM7

# Make sure this matches the baudrate on the Arduino's Serial.begin() call.
baudrate:9600

# You can use this to invert the sliders: top is low volume, bottom is high volume.
inverted:False

# Set this to true if you want system sounds included in 'unmapped' if system sounds aren't assigned anywhere else.
system in unmapped:True
